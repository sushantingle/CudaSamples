# CudaSamples
Cuda Samples to demonstrate understanding of CUDA and GPU Architecture.

- **CudaSamples** : Default project created with Visual Studio 2019. Its an addition program.
- **WarpSample** : This project demonstrates Warp creations. It prints warp allocation layout in different blocks.
- **ParallelReduction** : Different parallel reduction techniques are implemented in this sample.
  - Neighboured Pair Approach
  - To remove divergence in above approach:
    - Force Add neighbours
    - Interleaved Pair
  - Unrolling : Add blocks manually and then perform interleaved approach.
